> [!NOTE]
> Clipboard Manager is no longer under active development and is no longer being maintained. While the project gained some traction, it wasn't enough to justify continued development.

> The application will remain available to download and use, but no new features or major updates are planned. If you encounter any issues, you're still welcome to open an issue on GitHub, and I'll do my best to help resolve it.

## Features

- **Clipboard history** — last 50 entries, text & images
- **Smart deduplication** — re-copied content moves to top
- **Persistent history** across reboots
- **Pinning** — pin important entries so they always appear at the top, are never evicted, and survive "clear all"
- **Smart content detection** — automatically categorizes entries as 🔗 Link, 📧 Email, 🎨 Color, 📁 Path, 📞 Phone, 💻 Code, or 📝 Text
- **Sensitive content detection** — detects API keys, tokens, private keys, JWTs, and credit card numbers; masks them by default
- **Emoji/emoticon picker** — browse 8 categories in a grid layout, search by name, and paste with Enter
- **Auto-detection** of Hyprland with floating window rules
- **Background daemon** + `ratatui` TUI
- **Wayland** (`wl-clipboard`) and **X11** support

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grenish/clipboard-manager/main/install.sh | bash
```

To install a specific version:

```bash
VERSION=v0.1.6 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grenish/clipboard-manager/main/install.sh | bash
```

### AUR (Arch Linux)
> Outdated

```bash
yay -S clipboard-manager-rs-git
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grenish/clipboard-manager.git
cd clipboard-manager
cargo install --path .
```

> Wayland users need `wl-clipboard` installed. Auto-paste is not yet implemented.

## Usage

**1. Start the daemon** (add to your WM startup):

```bash
clipboard-manager &
```

```ini
# Hyprland example
exec-once = clipboard-manager
```

**2. Bind a hotkey** to the trigger script:

```ini
bind = SUPER, V, exec, ~/.local/share/clipboard-manager/trigger.sh
```

The daemon auto-creates `~/.local/share/clipboard-manager/trigger.sh` on first run and configures Hyprland window rules automatically.

## Keybindings

### Main View

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate entries |
| `Enter` | Copy & paste selected entry |
| `/` | Search clipboard history |
| `P` | Toggle pin on selected entry |
| `R` | Reveal / hide a masked secret |
| `E` | Open emoji picker |
| `C` | Clear all history except pinned entries (with confirmation) |
| `Esc` / `q` | Quit |

### Emoji Picker

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate grid rows |
| `←` / `→` | Navigate grid cells |
| `Tab` / `⇧Tab` | Switch category |
| `Enter` | Copy & paste selected emoticon |
| Type | Search emoticons by name |
| `Esc` | Close picker / clear search |

### Search

Searching matches against content text **and** category labels — type `code`, `email`, `link`, `secret`, etc. to filter by detected type.

## Smart Detection

Entries are automatically categorized at display time with no extra storage:

| Icon | Category | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| 🔗 | Link | URLs starting with `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://` |
| 📧 | Email | Addresses matching `user@domain.tld` |
| 🎨 | Color | Hex codes like `#ff5733`, `rgb(...)`, `hsl(...)` |
| 📁 | Path | Unix paths like `/home/user/file.txt`, `~/docs` |
| 📞 | Phone | Phone numbers like `+1-555-123-4567` |
| 💻 | Code | Multi-line text with code indicators (`{`, `fn`, `def`, etc.) |
| 📝 | Text | Everything else |

## Sensitive Content Protection

The clipboard manager detects sensitive content and protects it automatically:

- **Detected providers**: OpenAI, GitHub, AWS, Slack, Stripe, Google/Gemini, and more
- **Detected patterns**: API key prefixes, private key blocks, JWTs, Bearer tokens, credit card numbers (Luhn check), high-entropy secrets
- **Auto-masking**: secrets are displayed as `••••••••` by default
- **Controls**: press `R` to reveal / hide a masked secret

## Hyprland Troubleshooting

The app auto-detects your Hyprland version and applies the correct window rules. If the window doesn't float, add manually:

**v0.53+:**
```ini
windowrule = float on, match:class floating-clipboard
```

**v0.52 and older:**
```ini
windowrulev2 = float, class:(floating-clipboard)
windowrulev2 = size 900 600, class:(floating-clipboard)
windowrulev2 = center, class:(floating-clipboard)
```

## Data & Security

- **Storage**: `~/.local/share/clipboard-manager/`
- **History**: `clipboard_history.jsonl` (JSONL format, unencrypted)
- **Images**: `images/` subdirectory
- **Secrets**: masked in the TUI by default; reveal with `R`

Clipboard content is stored in plain text. Be mindful when copying sensitive data.

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/clipboard-manager
rm -rf ~/.local/share/clipboard-manager
```
